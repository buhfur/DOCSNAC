# DOCSNAC

Having trouble with those bland assignments? know the anwers but dont want to send the effort to look them up, type them into a text doc, and repeat the same process? well then this application might be for you! This project aims to defeat the almighty plaigiarism checker (gasp). However i am not responsible if you get caught :p as this is for educational purposes only (dons bright halo). Right now the project is in its early stages but i hope to complete this project near the end of the year. With that being said this project shall remain open source so anyone can contribute to slaying the mighty "checkers". documentation should be available in the near future (hopefully a month from now when im not too busy with school).
