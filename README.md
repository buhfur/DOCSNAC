# DOCSNAC


This is DOCSNAC, your tool for auto-completing your assignments!
this tool tries to find the best result for a question that is found in a text document.
It then tries to mimic a person typing the message instead of directly writing to it.



- when starting up the application:
  - you will be prompted for the directory of your text file.
  - for ex). C:\DOCSNAC\example.py
  - it might take a bit, but you will see a bunch of html(ignore it )
  - afterwards you will be prompted to enter the name of the file where your answers will be stored.
  - be sure to use the correct extension (.txt) or the application might not work correctly.
  - and voila! you now have a bunch of text, look out for updates as i will be trying to find methods to trim down the text in order to get a clear, parsed answer!
